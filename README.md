# pymilvus-deep-research

This repository provides a codebase for prototyping an application that can download and read Wikipedia pages, perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) queries, and compare the performance of various open-source reasoning models. These models are quantized to 4 bits for efficient local execution. The codebase is built based on the information and techniques provided in this blog post [[1]](https://milvus.io/blog/i-built-a-deep-research-with-open-source-so-can-you.md) by [milvus.io](https://milvus.io/).

# Install dependencies

To install the dependencies, the user may use `poetry==1.8.3` run the following commands to run the installation:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel poetry==1.8.3
$ poetry config virtualenvs.create false && poetry install --no-root --verbose
```


# Assumptions
The following assumptions are made to simplify the scope of the project:

- Only 4-bit quantized models are used to ensure the pipeline runs locally

- No additional fine-tuning on the reasoning models are performed

- The agent only has access to only Wikipedia (not the entire knowledge base on the web) and perform RAG queries

- Only text data is processed 

- The agent will not backtrack or consider pivots
